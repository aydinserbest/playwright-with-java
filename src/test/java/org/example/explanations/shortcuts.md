To remove unused imports and optimize your imports in IntelliJ IDEA on your MacBook, 
you can use the following shortcut:

Control + Option + O  (letter O)

This will automatically remove any unused imports 
and optimize the list of imports in the current file.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, 
the shortcut might be different based on the installed extensions, 
but you can usually press Shift + Option + O 
to organize imports if you have the proper Java or JavaScript extensions installed.
